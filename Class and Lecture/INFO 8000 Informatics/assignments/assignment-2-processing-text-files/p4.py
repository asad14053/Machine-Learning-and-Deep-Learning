# Come up with your own problem and solution.  
# The problem should illustrate a use of for loops to iterate over the lines of the contents of p4.txt. 
# It should only use native python and shouldn't duplicate the spirit of any of the other problems
# Note, p4.txt is currently empty.  You should decide what goes into it.  

# Correct problems will be posted (with solutions) as practice for others (anonymized)
