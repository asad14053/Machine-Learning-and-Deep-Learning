Dear all,

I am providing a link to you to learn about cross-validation. It is super simple and have a python example in the end. Check the discussion on how you load and clean data, and then, how to perform cross validation using 2 models (after ~20 min).

There are many other videos. This is very simple and slow pace.

Dear all,

Thank you all for working hard on your homework. I saw that you learned a lot and used this knowledge to do an even better job in your image focused classification projects (does not apply to all).

I spend some time with a couple of students stating that they complained they could not find anything about cats and dogs, that they are confused, that there is no info or code online or that they did not have time to check.

I used Google and searched for Cats and Dogs code machine learning python. Not only I have found a lot of documentation with code but also it took me 5 min to find a video that solves the whole problem step by step.

There are many other links with code and documentation. Most code is on Deep Learning but there are also ML solutions.

Also, note that the DL code online on cats and dogs, uses code on how to read, prepare, preprocess data, cross validation etc. This code is the SAME in ML and DL so again the solutions are right there. This problem in NOT new and also not easy. It just need that you invest the time.

Thank you

TB

PS I know I have asked to use Matlab. However, i would never give you a bad grade if you actually use any programming language and solve the problem. I have stated that many times. The goal is to learn ML not to learn Matlab.

All, Please see the latest slides I am uploading. Please check basic slides on Lectures 15, 16, 17 (no Audio - easy slides to read) and 18-19 (with AUDIO - here you need more explanation).

On Monday 1 more presentation is left and we will go through the Mid Term. If time is left we will discuss briefly the lectures you will study this Friday.

Keep Updating your Google Drive Documents based on the discussions we had this and last week (HW and Project).

Note 4 weeks are left. Please focus on your projects.

>>>>> READING MATERIAL >>>>>>

Actually, scikit has so much material and examples that you can find many things that you have questions to help you.

Dear all,

While I have discussed clearly in class the study material for your exam, it will be good to have it on paper too. Thus, here are the slides that you need to pay attention and are sufficient for your exam:

Week 3 - Talk about Data in Machine Learning - All slides
Weeks 5 and 6 - Duda Pattern Recognition - All 3 Deck of slides (3 uploaded presentations) --> Bayesian Decision Rule, Risks, Cost etc.
Week 7 - ML / LR / LG - All deck of slides: model, cost function, formulas.
Equations: I was asked today about equations that you will need to remember and whether I will provide all formulas and equations. The answer is no. In all your slides there are no complex equations and formulas. We have repeatedly discussed all details of the basic equations and formulas and you will need to remember and explain their parameters. You already know them and from all class discussions I have asked you related questions and noticed that you know the answers. Aside from 1-2 students that still struggle for some reason with the basic formulas, all the rest already know the answers.  Those that are still uncertain and struggle I have one advice. Study.

Good luck for Monday and please spend the time to prepare. You will do great.

Thanks

TB

Dear all,

Many asked me what projects can you work on. Please see examples: https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2021spr/

Avoid:

selecting a project just because sounds interesting.
selecting a project that your current former company is working on; where they will give you data etc.
selecting a project that is your current MS/PhD research or UGR research with another professor and you are planning potentially to publish
selecting a project where you want to start simulating a lot of data (that are not images) that you will not be able to understand, unless you have a good back ground on the topic, e.g. a cybersecurity project
To do: select a project that

You can find data -> use Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or other online resources;
The number of  samples per class (e.g. cats and dogs > you need images for each class) need to be at least 2-5K to be able to show good results
You can find some code online to solve the problem > use github; Google "code Python .... project"
I hope my input helps.

Thanks

TB
