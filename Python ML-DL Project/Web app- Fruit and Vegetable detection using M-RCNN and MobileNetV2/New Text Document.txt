Computer vision can be used to detect fruits in images or videos using various techniques such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. Here is an overview of the steps involved in fruit detection using computer vision:


Data collection: Gather a large dataset of fruit images with different variations in lighting, angle, and background.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and applying filters to improve the quality of the images.

Object detection: Use object detection algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD to detect fruit objects in the images. These algorithms use deep learning models trained on large datasets to identify and localize objects in the images.

Segmentation: Use semantic segmentation or instance segmentation algorithms to separate individual fruits from each other and from the background.

Classification: Use a deep learning model such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the detected fruits into different categories such as apple, banana, orange, etc.

Post-processing: Apply post-processing techniques such as non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections and refine the final output.


The output of the fruit detection system can be used in various applications such as automated fruit sorting, quality control in food processing, and fruit yield estimation in agriculture.
