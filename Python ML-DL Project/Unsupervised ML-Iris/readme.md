## Unsupervised Learning on Iris Dataset
* Technology: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering

### Result:
* The both Failed on only 16 data points over 150 data points, which is equal to 90% accuracy. We also see that clustering "iris-setosa" was easy for both of them (50/50 success) because it's data points are all easily differentiable
15 mistakes of all 16 is coming from "iris-virginica". Which shows that it was hard to cluster for my models.
